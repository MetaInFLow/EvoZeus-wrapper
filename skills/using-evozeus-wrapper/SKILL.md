name: using-evozeus-wrapper
description: Use whenever EvoZeus-wrapper is invoked to diagnose, bootstrap, adopt, repair, verify, publish, reinstall, release, or migrate a wrapped Skill, AGENTS.md runtime kit, or hook/plugin-controlled Skill bundle. This is the operating Skill for the wrapper lifecycle; root SKILL.md only routes here.

# Using EvoZeus Wrapper

Use this Skill as the operating guide for EvoZeus-wrapper. The root `SKILL.md` only anchors discovery and routing.

EvoZeus-wrapper is not the user entrypoint. EvoZeus decides when a promoted Skill, existing local Skill folder, runtime kit, or hook/plugin-controlled Skill bundle needs repoization, feedback capture, release governance, or wrapper migration.

## First Principles

A static Skill is only useful if it can improve from real use without losing accountability. The wrapper must turn every evolution into a traceable loop:

```text
weak result
  -> feedback Issue
  -> design doc
  -> PR
  -> CHANGELOG
  -> release notes
  -> latest release check before next run
  -> updated Skill
```

Keep one source of truth:

- one physical canonical GitHub repo clone for the target Skill or runtime kit
- `~/.evozeus/.projects/OWNER/REPO` pointing to the canonical repo
- `~/.codex/skills/<skill-name>` and optional `~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>` as runtime pointers to that canonical repo

Do not let copied runtime installs become another source of truth.

## Source Discovery Order

For wrapper-managed targets, discover source state in this order:

1. Read `.evozeus-wrapper/wrapper.json`. If only an old manifest exists, route to layout migration first.
2. Check `~/.evozeus/.projects/OWNER/REPO`.
3. Verify canonical repo origin and GitHub repo access.
4. Inspect `.codex` / `.agents` runtime installs only as pointers.
5. Use GitHub user / org / public search only when wrapper state is absent.

## Required Inputs

Before writing anything, identify:

- Target folder: absolute local path.
- Target type: root `SKILL.md`, root `AGENTS.md` runtime kit, multi-Skill bundle, or hook/plugin-controlled Skill bundle.
- Target GitHub repo: `OWNER/REPO`.
- Visibility: `public` or `private`.
- Skill / kit display name.
- Whether target-owned initialization is required, including its command and verification command.
- Whether the target generates child Skills that need separate wrapper and hook onboarding.
- Evidence boundary: public examples only, redacted examples, or private material.

If visibility is missing, ask before creating or pushing anything.

## Version Standard

Use `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- `MAJOR`: incompatible Skill behavior, required input, or output contract change.
- `MINOR`: new capability, new required evidence rule, or new harness behavior.
- `PATCH`: wording, examples, bug fixes, validation fixes, or non-breaking clarifications.

Initial wrapped release is `v0.1.0` only for a new target repo with no prior Skill release.

For an existing target repo, preserve its current Skill / kit version:

1. GitHub latest release tag is the current version.
2. If GitHub has no release but `.evozeus-wrapper/CHANGELOG.md` has a latest `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` entry, create or verify that release before runtime use.
3. If neither exists, stop and ask the owner to choose the current version.

Wrapper harness version is separate and recorded in `.evozeus-wrapper/wrapper.json`.

## Lifecycle

### 1. Environment Diagnosis

Use `skills/environment-diagnosis/SKILL.md`.

```bash
python3 scripts/evozeus_wrapper.py env diagnose --json
```

If the result says `next_action: install_evozeus`, install / initialize EvoZeus before touching the target repo.

### 2. Target Repo Diagnosis

Use `skills/target-skill-diagnosis/SKILL.md`.

```bash
python3 scripts/evozeus_wrapper.py skill diagnose \
  --target /absolute/path/to/target-skill-or-kit \
  --repo OWNER/REPO \
  --json
```

The diagnosis script reports facts only:

- GitHub access, visibility, default branch, and current account permission
- target kind: `single_skill`, `runtime_skill_bundle`, `hooked_skill_bundle`, `skill_bundle`, `agents_runtime`, or `unknown`
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` inventory
- evolution surface candidates and controller files
- runtime integration mode: `native_host_hook`, `bootstrap_skill`, `prompt_runtime_check`, or `manual_only`
- Codex hook registration evidence from `.codex/hooks.json` and `.evozeus-wrapper/hooks/evozeus_wrapper_start_check.py`
- wrapper component gaps
- source contract and runtime install state

Do not treat script-produced `evolution_surface.candidates` as final placement.

### 3. Evolution Surface Diagnosis

Use `skills/evolution-surface-diagnosis/SKILL.md`.

Browse the whole target repo enough to prove what controls agent behavior:

- root instruction files such as `AGENTS.md` or `SKILL.md`
- plugin manifests
- session/startup hooks
- candidate control Skills under `skills/*/SKILL.md`
- architecture docs only when they clarify the control chain

Choose `instruction_surface` only from repo evidence. For hook/plugin-controlled systems, pass the chosen relative path into transform with `--instruction-surface`.

Do not call a wrapper CLI command a runtime hook. `native_host_hook` requires Codex project-local hook files or other host/plugin lifecycle hook evidence. `prompt_runtime_check` is only prompt-compliance fallback.

### 4. Status Assessment

Use `skills/status-assessment/SKILL.md`.

Explain to the user:

- environment status
- GitHub access
- repo architecture
- chosen instruction surface and evidence
- runtime integration mode and whether host hook evidence exists
- missing wrapper components
- version status
- blockers
- next command

Do not move this user-facing judgment into Python scripts.

### 5. Transform

Use `skills/target-skill-transform/SKILL.md`.

```bash
python3 scripts/evozeus_wrapper.py skill transform \
  --mode <bootstrap|adopt|repair|verify> \
  --target /absolute/path/to/target-skill-or-kit \
  --repo OWNER/REPO \
  --instruction-surface <relative path> \
  --visibility <public|private> \
  --dry-run \
  --json
```

For `verify`, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/evozeus_wrapper.py skill transform --mode verify --target /absolute/path/to/target-skill-or-kit
```

Transform must add wrapper-owned material only. It must not rewrite target business rules.

### 6. Publish And Reinstall

Use `skills/publish-reinstall/SKILL.md`.

```bash
python3 scripts/evozeus_wrapper.py publish reinstall \
  --skill-name target-skill \
  --canonical-path /absolute/path/to/canonical/repo \
  --target codex \
  --dry-run \
  --json
```

Runtime installs should become symlinks or pointers to the canonical repo, not copied forks.
Run the same command without `--dry-run` to apply missing or incorrect symlinks. If the plan finds a real directory, review it and rerun with `--approve-archive`; the original is moved under `~/.evozeus/archives/runtime-installs/`, never deleted.

The generated manifest records onboarding separately from wrapper implementation:

- installation uses a canonical repo symlink;
- invocation remains owned by the target Skill's canonical `SKILL.md`;
- required initialization must provide both a target-owned command and verification;
- child Skills do not inherit parent hooks and require a separate wrapper lifecycle, `/hooks` trust review, structure preflight, and consumer-project smoke test.

### 7. Evolution Loop

Use `skills/evolution-loop/SKILL.md`.

Every behavior change must flow through:

```text
feedback Issue -> design doc -> PR -> CHANGELOG -> release -> latest release check
```

When feedback comes from a live user correction or dissatisfaction signal, first run:

```bash
python3 scripts/evozeus_wrapper.py loop audit --target /absolute/path/to/target-skill --user-input "<input>" --json
```

Use the returned route, severity, evidence boundary, and Issue draft before creating or recommending a Skill Feedback Issue.

### 8. Harness Upgrade

Use `skills/harness-upgrade/SKILL.md`.

```bash
python3 scripts/evozeus_wrapper.py harness upgrade-check \
  --target /absolute/path/to/target-skill-or-kit \
  --json

python3 scripts/evozeus_wrapper.py harness migrate-layout \
  --target /absolute/path/to/target-skill-or-kit \
  --latest-version v0.9.0 \
  --dry-run \
  --json
```

Apply the same `migrate-layout` command without `--dry-run` only after the plan has no conflicts and the user approves it. Migration moves old wrapper files into `.evozeus-wrapper/`, rewrites references, updates the layout v2 manifest, records the migration, and removes only empty legacy wrapper directories. It must not rewrite target Skill business logic.

For wrapper `v0.7.0+`, the target harness must include Codex project-local hook registration:

- `.codex/hooks.json` registers `SessionStart` for `startup|resume|clear|compact`.
- `.evozeus-wrapper/hooks/evozeus_wrapper_start_check.py` reads `.evozeus-wrapper/wrapper.json` and emits Codex hook JSON.
- Non-managed hooks require Codex review/trust through `/hooks` before they run.
- The hook resolves the authoritative GitHub latest release on each SessionStart. If lookup fails, advisory mode warns and strict mode blocks; it never compares the current version with itself.

## GitHub Operations

Use `gh` only after local target files and visibility are reviewed.

For a new public repo:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initialize wrapped Skill dashboard"
gh repo create OWNER/REPO --source . --public --push
gh release create v0.1.0 --repo OWNER/REPO --target main \
  --title "v0.1.0" \
  --notes "Initial wrapped Skill harness."
```

For private repos, use `--private`. Do not put sensitive content into `.evozeus-wrapper/docs/`; GitHub Pages can become an external publishing surface depending on plan and settings.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and ask when:

- `~/.evozeus` is missing.
- `git` or `gh` is missing, or `gh auth status` fails.
- target repo visibility is not chosen.
- target repo name or canonical source is ambiguous.
- GitHub write permission cannot be verified.
- bootstrap was selected but the target GitHub repo already exists.
- existing target repo has no GitHub release and no `.evozeus-wrapper/CHANGELOG.md` version entry.
- an old scattered layout is detected but its migration plan has conflicts.
- no controlling instruction surface can be proven.
- the user wants to publish secrets, raw private sessions, customer data, or unredacted commercial context.
- GitHub Pages would expose sensitive content.

## Output Shape

Keep user-facing output concise and factual:

1. Current lifecycle stage.
2. Target repo and canonical path.
3. GitHub access and visibility.
4. Architecture and instruction surface decision.
5. Missing components and blockers.
6. Next command.
7. Verification results.
